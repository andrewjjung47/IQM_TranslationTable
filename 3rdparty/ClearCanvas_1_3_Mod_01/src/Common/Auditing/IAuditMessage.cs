	/// to log the message to the appropriate Audit Repository.  In this scenario, the

	/// to the Audit Repository (whatever that may be: text file, logging service, etc).  The implementation
	/// of <see cref="IAuditMessage"/> is responsible for gathering the required information to format the
	/// message appropriately.
